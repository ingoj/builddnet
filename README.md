# builddnet
Scripts and resources for former Buildd.Net webseite, which was a view on the Debian Autobuilder Network of buildds on various archs. 

This is a copy of an old SVN repository. As this is old source code, partially depending on Python2, it will not run out-of-the-box and need heavy rewriting.
