You won't or you cannot?

Anyway, I think it is pretty obvious by now to anyone following this
list that you're not really interested in contributing.

Hmmm, when you see this page, then it must be because you're seeking information, from which his Highnest (aka DPL) says, that I don't contribute to the project.<br>
And because I'm not contributing and not even <b>willing</b> to contribute, you'll see this page today between 19:15 CEST and 24:00 CEST. The DPL is always right, so I think it's my duty to follow his opinion, because I'm just a little non-DD that doesn't contribute anything in his eyes. So I have to follow... ;)<p>
No, this is not ill minded, this is minded by fun of a contributing volunteer. Maybe you want to <a href="cgi/vote.phtml>play a game</a> in the meanwhile?
