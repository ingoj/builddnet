<br>
He developed some Amiga Hardware like Ariadne I & II, PicassoII & IV
and many other Mac cards as well. Klaus personally donated the Ariadne
NIC in kullervo on a Linux meeting in Oldenburg. He was really from the
bottom of his heart a true Amiga-Fan and gave finally his life for it.
He worked night & day at Village Tronic to develop new hardware, wrote
drivers, and communicated with community, and having no holidays for
years - always stressed, always busy, always helpful.
