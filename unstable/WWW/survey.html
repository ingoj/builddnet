other:
- Coolness factor. I like to show off that ancient old equipment is viable. 
  The members of my LUG are always impressed.
- File server, boot and NBD server for my new router,
  router before that [near noisless server]
- I have two 68k linux boxes also. One is a spare for the mailserver, as 
  a rebuild isn't a quick process on them :)
- kernel development
- testing cross-compiled kernels
- File server, backup server 
  (Soon, I'll use it more often, when I can access it from outside my
  private network through a permanent DSL connexion.
  ps: It's got plenty of qualities, that few computers have today:
  - silent
  - doesn't eat up amounts of electricity
  - doesn't warm the atmosphere up several degrees
  - is beautiful (Mac Q630)
  )
- Every days work, but not KDE/Gnome
- testing home made cards and software
- checking compilation on m68k to test portability of code
- Playing/tinkering/experimenting with making modern software
  run on such old hardware (Linux 2.6, the freedesktop.org X server,
  etc.).  (Not development.)  Plan to use it as a network X terminal
  once I fix my X problems. (If it is of any interest, the system is
  a Macintosh Centris 610.)
- have it as a dumb terminal to my much faster box.
- Was running an email relay server and DNS off of a Mac SE/30. 
  Crashed a few months ago.  Will resurrect as soon as I have
  time :). Have plans on doing the same for many, many more 68Ks.
- to rant about PC architecture, cat /proc/hardware is way cool.
- big-endian testing
- I have a Mac Quadra 840AV that is in pieces (many pieces -- the thing is
  a bitch to take apart and even worse to put back together).  I've been
  meaning to obtain 64 more megs of RAM for, and re-commission it.
- developing and testing software
- developing software, porting it to Linux
- Learning about the Linux kernel.
