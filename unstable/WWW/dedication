This machine is dedicated in memory to Klaus 'crest' Burkert who died in
April 2001 aged 33 by a cardiac infarction.
He developed some Amiga Hardware like Ariadne I & II, PicassoII & IV and many
other Mac cards as well. Klaus personally donated the
Ariadne NIC in kullervo on a Linux meeting in Oldenburg. He was really from
the buttom of his heart a true Amiga-Fan and gave finally his life for it.
He worked night & day at Village Tronic to develop new hardware, wrote
drivers, and communicated with community, and having no holidays for years -
always stressed, always busy, always helpful.
